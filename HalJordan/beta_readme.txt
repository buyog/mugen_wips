Blackest Night Hal Jordan: private beta test (1/24 - 1/28, 2011)

First of all, thank you all for giving Hal a thorough shake-down.
He's almost completely changed since the last version, and I'm 
sure there are bugs Arma and I haven't found yet. Your help in 
catching them will make him a better release. :)

Secondly, I hope I don't have to tell you that this is a PRIVATE release. 
PLEASE, no sharing with anybody else! (YouTube vids would be okay, though, 
with proper attribution to Arma and I).


I'm counting on you.


Thirdly, I'd like to get your feedback within the next 48-72 hours (2-3 days),
so I can (hopefully) release him this weekend. Please email me (ryan@buyog.com)
whatever feedback you have by that time.

Now, a quick rundown of what's in, and what's still missing. (If it's in this list, please don't report it at a bug, because I already know about it ;)):


WHAT'S IN (a ! indicates it's got problems):
---------

Common (All or most modes):
* Throw              F + HP  (new, thanks to SathZankuten)
				(please test on lots of chars, big and small.)
* Taunt:             START   (lantern charge; this is now the main way to increase your power bar)

Specials:
* Ring Strike        QCF + P
* Emerald Swordsman  QCF + P (in air only)
* Charging Ram       QCF + K (ground/air)
* Buzzcut            QCB + P (tweaked a bit from before)
* Plasma Sphere      QCB + K

Hypers:
* Knockout           QCF + PP
* Smackdown          QCF + PK  (I moved the command for Smackdown from QCB+PP 
				to QCF + PK (punch & kick of equal strength)
* Emerald Knight     QCF + KK
* Ion Force          QCB + PP (brand new hyper, thanks to SethZankuten)
* Ring Slinging      QCB + KK
* Soldier of Oa      QCB + PK

== Red Lantern (palette 07: START + LK) ==
! passive enhancement: can't be thrown by most standard throw moves
* quirk: your life very slowly ticks away during the match. Beat your opponent, quick!
! Special 1: Plasma Vomit (replaces Ring Strike)
* Special 2: Jet Rush (replaces Charging Ram)
* Hyper: Flames of Rage (replaces Soldier of Oa)

== Orange Lantern (palette 08: START + MK) ==
! passive enhancement: hyper moves cost half as much power as normal
* quirk: no taunt to recharge the lantern; when it's gone, it's gone (but it starts every round full)
* Special 1: Selfish Grab (replaces Plasma Sphere)
* Special 2: "Go Away!" (replaces Emerald Swordsman)
! Hyper: Construct Corps (replaces Soldier of Oa)

== Yellow Lantern (palette 09: START + HK)
* passive enhancement: moves do more damage
! quirk: moves take slightly more power to use
* Special 1: Sinister Sabres (replaces Buzzcut)
! Special 2: Cruel Grip (squeezing sphere; replaces Plasma Sphere)
* Hyper: Golden Dragons (replaces KO/Smackdown)

== Blue+Green Lantern (palette 10: START + LP)
* passive enhancement: powerbar quickly recharges whenever you're idle for a short time
! quirk: moves sometimes interrupted by the ring asking "what do you hope for?"
* Special 1: Ring Blast (bigger beam; replaces Ring Strike)
* Special 2: Massive Discharge (huge air blast wave)
! Hyper: Ion Wave (a la Magnetic Shockwave; replaces Ion Force)

== Indigo Lantern (palette 11: START + MP)
* passive enhancement: defense stats are slightly higher, so he'll take a bit less damage than normal
* quirk: unblocked attacks decrease both health and power bar
* Special 1: Teleport (replaces Charging Ram)
! Special 2: Nek Ler Klok (Energy Redirect) (replaces Plasma Sphere)
* Hyper: Enforced Empathy (replaces Emerald Knight)

== Black Lantern (palette 12: START + HP)
* passive enhancement: super-robust healing factor (health fully refills if you stand still for ~2 seconds)
* passive enhancement (2): specials cost no power bar to use
* quirk: power bar only increases with every KO'ed opponent (30% per win, persists between rounds)
* Special 1: Piercing Strike (replaces Ring Strike)
* Special 2: Deadly Embrace (i.e. skull swarm) (replaces Buzzcut)
! Hyper: Nekron Rising (replaces Ring Slinging)


WHAT'S STILL MISSING:
--------------------
General:
* the "Win by hyper" background is missing for the other corps modes.
* the "good over evil" winpose needs a little tweaking; I don't like the choppyness of the anim.

Red mode:
* the plasma vomit special may sometimes get "stuck" when you spam it too much. I haven't figured out why yet.
* no passive enhancement yet (does damage to P2 when grabbed/thrown)

Orange mode:
* no passive enhancement yet (hyper moves cost half as much power as normal)
* custom hyper is unfinished / broken

Yellow mode:
* no quirk yet (moves take slightly more power to use)
* custom special #2 is missing / not yet implemented

Blue+Green mode:
* no quirk yet (moves sometimes interrupted by the ring asking "what do you hope for?")
* the movement of the hyper blast waves is wrong
* the intro should have a voice clip
* no winpose yet

Indigo mode:
* the staff shows up a tick or two too soon in custom Redirect special

Black mode:
* custom hyper isn't done: no sound or damage
