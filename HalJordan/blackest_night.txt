What's left:
    Globals:
    * fix timing on basic attacks (working on this now)
    * add/change constructs to several more of the basics
    * timeover tie voice is wrong
    * check some basic punches for wrong-colored hands (use bluegreen.pal to identify)
    * smackdown needs CLSN2s
    * winpose 3 (183) needs a little anim work

    Red:
    * [Arma] special: When you repeat to much times the HP plasma vomit he get stucked, try it 

    Orange:
    * passive enhancement (hyper moves cost half as much power as normal)
    * hyper: Construct Corps

    Yellow:
    * quirk (moves take slightly more power to use)
    * voice for special 1...?
    * special 2: Cruel Grip

    Blue:
    * quirk (moves sometimes interrupted by the ring asking "what do you hope for?")
    * intro should have some SFX
    * needs a winpose!

    Indigo:
    * quirk (unblocked projectile attacks decrease both health and power bar)
    * staff shows up a tick or two too soon in redirect special

    Black:
    * finish hyper: Nekron Rising
