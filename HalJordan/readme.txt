!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Things that will hack me off related to the use of this character:
- Don't host it on your site unless you ASK me first, and give me
    proper credit. Email isn't hard, and I'll probably say yes,
    so don't be afraid to ask. =P
- If you got this character from somewhere other than ScruffyDragon.com 
    or my site, Buyog.com, it's quite possible that it's been hacked and/or modified
    without my permission, and not all the moves and animations may be very good.
    Best to get it from a trusted source and be confident in its integrity.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

NOTE:
Hal was developed entirely on No-Limit WinMUGEN; I have no idea if he'll even work right on DOS/Linux/RC MUGEN, because I haven't deemed it important enough to try. But, I've made every effort to do things the "right" way, so hopefully that means it'll work.

If you have any issues playing this character on any flavor of MUGEN, drop me a line via my blog, email, or the ScruffyDragon forum.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

GAMEPLAY:

Hal's got the 6-button play style typical of Capcom's Vs series:

x - Weak Punch (WP)
y - Medium Punch (MP)
z - Hard Punch (HP)
a - Weak Kick (WK)
b - Medium Kick (MK)
c - Hard Kick (HK)

d,u:  Super Jump (KKK will trigger it too)
f,f:  Dash Forward
b,b:  Dash Back

==

COMBO SYSTEM

Capcom-style chain combos work for standing, crouching, and air:
1. WP+MP+SP: you can chain the three punches together, weakest to strongest, for a 3 hit combo.
2. WK+MK+SK: like the punches, you can chain the three kicks together as well.
3. (in air) WP+WK+MP+MK+SP: The basic "zigzag" combo. Chains up to 6 hits.

Launcher: crouching hard kick

CREDITS

I couldn't have come this far without help and encouragement from a LOT of people.
Here are some of the ones that have really gone out of their way to help me out...
if I've missed you, I'm sorry! Let me know and I'll credit you in the next release.

- PrimeOp:
  - for inspiration to do this guy in the first place (I was going to do crab-mask Kyle Rayner)
  - for the lantern-charge intro, winpose, flight stance, Ring Strike special, and the dynamic pose used in the Plasma Sphere special
  - for the Iron Man MvC portrait
- DG & McCready for letting me use the sparks he put into Guido after I handed him off.
- X-Boy for the costume-change intro
- The following people for donated work on Hal's specials:
  - Paw (original idea for the ram attack)
  - L@nce Uppercut (Buzzcut)
  - Apathy (Emerald Swordsman)
- Adam C for the Midnight Bliss sprite
- Larramones for prototyping the Spectre intro
- Pychewing and BobStarsky for their combined efforts on the DCvM portrait (sorry I missed you last time, Bob!)
- AngelEcks for the Knockout sprites
- Magus for the Emerald Knight concept and sprites, and some bloodsquirts for Red Lantern mode
- Turbanator (SKRON) for the horse rips.
- ThePacifist for the temporary AI
- Carnificina for his great tutorial on implementing super armor

- SethZankuten for several tweaked/new moves:
  - Anvil Slam grapple
  - construct effects on standing basics
  - Ion Force hyper
- Amon-Ra for his various Hal-as-X-Corps sprites, which Armageddon and I used as the basis for a lot of the custom mode intros or stances
- Jet the Phoenix for a phenomenal smart palette that makes the various Corps custom modes much nicer to look at
- ArmageddoN for jumping in with both feet and spriting almost all of the custom intros, stances, winposes, and attacks used in the alternate Corps modes
- FlowaGirl for her many code tutorials & tips... you'll notice I use them quite a bit :^)
- The folks on the ScruffyDragon, Warmachine Madness, & ScrollBoss/Prime Central Station forums for feedback, support, and ideas... this one's been a LOOONG time coming!
- The entire DC vs Marvel / Scruffy Dragon team... a more talented, loyal group of friends than any I've ever had before online.
